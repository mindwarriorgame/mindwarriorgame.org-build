        <ol start="1"><li><strong>Everything comes from somewhere and goes somewhere. </strong>
                    <ul><li>can you send a smile to this "somewhere"?</li><li>which obstacles do you have with this?</li></ul></li></ol>

            <ol start="2"><li><strong>A clouded mind multiplies bad karma and suffering, yours and your neighbors'</strong>
                    <ul><li>all evil deeds, big and small, were committed by people with a clouded mind</li></ul></li></ol>

            <ol start="3"><li><strong> Disassemble your mind into the observer, the observed, and the background</strong>
                    <ul><li>realize that clinging to the observed is meaningless and futile</li><li>what made you think that this is the truth? How many times has it let you down?</li><li>what made you think that this is of any value? What made you think that this makes sense?</li><li>clinging is not for the good</li><li>do not cling to the observed (thoughts/feelings/sensations). Who is the observer? What is the background? That's where the focus is.</li></ul></li></ol>

            <h1>Right now you are most likely in a clouded state of mind</h1>

            <ul><li>you worry about things that do not exist (past and future)</li><li>you care about a fleeting pleasure/inconvenience that will soon disappear and you will not even remember it</li><li>you listen to the "inner voice" that carries some nonsense that has nothing to do with reality</li><li>you perceive reality not as an illusion</li><li>you consider other people as the source of your misfortunes
                    <ul><li>when your relative dies, you feel a great loss, but you are indifferent to the losses of others</li>
                        <li>you do not remember about your own death, your position in space/galaxy</li></ul></li>

            <h1>Being in a clouded state of mind, you create bad karma</h1>

            <ul><li>people who are in a clouded state of mind create an incredible amount of suffering. Continuing to be in it, you remain in the ranks with them: <strong>you are no better than any most terrible person</strong> that you can think of, the differences are purely circumstantial.
                    <ul><li>bad karma will bring you bad consequences</li><li>bad karma will increase suffering in the world</li></ul></li></ul>

            <h1>Get out now!</h1>

            <ul><li><strong>decide what karma you will create?</strong></li><li>focus on the present moment, it is all you have</li><li>remember that all your phenomena are just images, phantoms, husks. Watch how they arise and disappear. Where do they arise and disappear?</li><li><strong>divide into the observer, the observed and the stage on which everything happens, transfer your attention there</strong></li><li>transfer attention to breathing</li><li>reflect on the non-existence of the past and future. Why worry about them?</li><li>reflect on the transience of everything that happens. Why worry about it?</li><li>reflect on the limitations of your everyday perception (no focus on the inevitability of death, no focus on your position in space/cosmos, although these things are much more important than what you'll eat for breakfast; that the fish also believes that it knows reality as it is)</li><li>reflect on the fact that <strong>the external and other people cannot make you happy or unhappy</strong>, that this is your choice (think about the inflated expectations of loved ones, the same gloomy poor souls)</li><li>reflect on the happiness of being born a human in the 21st century</li></ul>
