    <h3>What is the purpose of the game?</h3>
    <p>
        The "MindWarrior" game was created to support you on your journey of personal growth, development, and transformation.
        The main concept of the game is the <a href="#formula"><i>Formula of firm resolution</i></a> – a private inspirational message
        that you write to yourself and then review regularly during the day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time you review your <i>Formula</i>, your thoughts are brought back to what really matters to you.
        This practice helps keep your mind clear and focused on the most important things, pulling it away from the dullness, noise, and distractions of everyday life.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-formula" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What should I write in my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        Your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i> is a private, free-form text message where you can
        write anything that has meaning to you. It could be your favorite quotes, mantras, reminders, wise thoughts
        and observations, or anything else – only you can decide! The only guidance is that it
        should motivate you on your personal journey of transformation and growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strong <i>Formula</i> <a href="#review">will keep you focused, motivated, and disciplined</a>. It will support you daily and help you
        stay engaged and committed. If you find yourself receiving constant reminders from the game about missed reviews, or if you start thinking of quitting the game,
        it might be a sign that your <i>Formula</i> requires a revision.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-review" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens when I review my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        Spiritually, each time you review your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i>, the focus of your mind
        is brought back to the most important things in your life, pulling you away from distractions and the nonsense
        of everyday life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Game-wise, when you review your <i>Formula</i> before the reminder, you earn additional in-game rewards and score.
    </p>

    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-forgot" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if I forget to review my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        If you forget to review your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i>, the game will remind you about it.
        Depending on the selected difficulty level, missed reviews might make it harder for you
        to unlock subsequent game levels.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/images/faq_en/review_minus_score.jpg" class="image-link" target="_blank">
            <img src="/images/faq_en/review_minus_score.jpg" width="450" height="435" alt="Image">        </a>
    </p>

    <p><strong>There are no penalties on the easiest level! 🚫😾</strong></p>

    <p id="smooth-forgot-grumpycat" class="anchor">
        To speed up the unlocking process, you can increase the frequency of reviewing the <i>Formula</i>,
        but rewards can only be issued once every 5 minutes.
    </p>
</div>


<div id="smooth-difficulty" class="faq-item">
    <h3>How often do I need to review my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        You can review your <i>Formula</i> as often as you'd like; however, rewards are only granted at most once every 5 minutes (the "cool-down" rule), even if you perform multiple reviews during that time.
    </p>

    <p>
        The recommended frequency of reviews and the penalties for missed ones are determined by the difficulty level of the game,
        which you can change at any time using the <span class="code-highlight">/difficulty</span> command.
        Higher difficulty levels usually require more consistent reviews and apply stronger penalties for missed ones.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-pause" class="faq-item">
    <h3>How can I take a break without penalties?</h3>

    <p>
        To take a break, simply pause the game with the <span class="pre">/pause</span> command.
    </p>

    <p>
        The paused game won't send you any notifications or change your game scores.
        The active play time counter will also stop counting.
        To resume the game, simply review your <i>Formula</i> as usual.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also set up a sleep interval. The game will be automatically paused (daily) during this time.
        To set it, go to the <span class="code-highlight">/settings</span> menu and press the <i>"💤 Sleep Scheduler"</i> button.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Important!</strong> If your <i>Formula</i> is reviewed during your "sleep interval", the game will resume.
        This means you might be penalized if you miss the next scheduled review (e.g., if one day you make a "late" review at a time when you typically sleep on other days).
        To avoid this, you can manually pause the game using the <span class="pre">/pause</span> command after completing a "late" review.</p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-formula-formatting" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I use text formatting in my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        The <i>Formula</i> editor supports <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">markdown syntax</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/images/faq_en/markdown.jpg" class="image-link" target="_blank">
            <img src="/images/faq_en/markdown.jpg" width="450" height="442" alt="Image">        </a>
    </p>

    <p>You can also use <span class="code-highlight">{counter}</span> and <span class="code-highlight">{stopwatch}</span>
    widgets to embed counters and stopwatches into your <i>Formula</i>. That might be useful if you want to manually track
    some progress.</p>

<div id="smooth-controls" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Which commands does the game have?</h3>
    <p>
        The game supports the following commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="pre">/review</span> - 💫 <a href="#review">review</a> your <i>Formula</i></li>

        </li>

        <li>
            <i>"💾 Personal Data"</i> – <a href="privacy-policy.en.html">view and examine the data that the game knows about you</a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>"📢 Feedback"</i> – link to a feedback form
        </li>

        <li>
            <i>"🌐 Change server"</i> – switch to a different game server if you experience technical issues
        </li>

<div id="smooth-formula-example" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I see Formulas of other players?</h3>

    <p>
        The "MindWarrior" game takes players' privacy very seriously.
        Your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i> is stored locally on your device and
        the game never copies or sends it to its servers.
        Therefore, it is physically impossible to see the <i>Formula</i> of a
        random player, simply because the game itself doesn't have access to it.
        (Please check our <a href="/privacy-policy.en.html" target="_blank">Privacy policy</a> for more details.)
    </p>
    <p>
        However, <strong>some players have voluntarily shared their <i>Formulas</i> publicly
            on our website</strong>. These formulas can be found on the
        "<a href="/public-formulas.en.html">Public Formulas</a>" page.
        Please feel free to check them out!
