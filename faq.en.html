    <h3>What is the purpose of the game?</h3>
    <p>
        "MindWarrior" game was created to help you on your journey of personal growth, development and transformation.
        The main concept of the game ‚Äì <a href="#formula"><i>Formula of firm resolution</i></a> ‚Äì is your private inspirational message
        that you write to yourself and then review regularly during the day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time you review your <i>Formula</i>, your thoughts are returned back to what really matters for you.
        This practice helps to keep your mind clear and focused on the most important things, pulling it away from the dullness, noise and distractions of everyday life.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-formula" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What should I write in my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        <i>Formula of firm resolution</i> is a private freeform text message, where you can
        write anything that has meaning to you. It could be your favorite quotes, mantras, reminders, wise thoughts
        and observations, or anything else, only you to decide! The only guidance is that it
        should motivate you on your personal journey of transformation and growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strong <i>Formula</i> <a href="#review">will keep you focused, motivated, and disciplined</a>. It will support you daily and will help
        to stay engaged
        and committed. If you find yourself receiving constant reminders from the game about missed reviews, or if you start thinking of quitting the game,
        maybe it might be a sign that your <i>Formula</i> requires a revision.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-review" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens when I review my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        Spiritually, each time you review your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i>, the focus of your mind
        is returned back to the most important things in your life, pulling you away from distractions and nonsense
        of everyday life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Game-wise, when you perform the review without being reminded about that,
        you earn game rewards!

    <div id="smooth-forgot" class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if you forget to review the "Formula"?</h3>

        <p>
            If you forget to review your <i>Formula of Firm Resolution</i>, the game will remind you about it.
            Depending on the selected difficulty level, missing reviews might make it harder for you
            to unlock subsequent game levels.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p id="smooth-forgot-grumpycat" class="anchor">
            To speed up the unlocking process, you can increase the frequency of reviewing the <i>Formula</i>,
            but no more than once every 5 minutes (otherwise, the review will not be counted).
        </p>
    </div>


<div id="smooth-difficulty" class="faq-item">
    <h3>How often do I need to review my Formula?</h3>

    <p>
        You can review your <i>Formula</i> as often as you'd like, however only the reviews performed at least
        5 minutes apart from each other will be rewarded ("cool-down" rule).
    </p>

    <p>
        The frequency of reviews and the penalties for missed ones are determined by the difficulty level of the game,
        which you could change at any time using <span class="code-highlight">/difficulty</span> command.
    </p>


</div>

<div id="smooth-pause" class="faq-item">
    <h3>How to take a break without penalties?</h3>

    <p>
        To take a break, simply pause the game with <span class="pre">/pause</span> command.
    </p>

    <p>
        The paused game won't send you any notifications or change your game scores.
        The active play time counter won't be counting, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        To resume the game, simply review your <i>Formula</i> as usually.

    <h3>Can I see Formulas of other players?</h3>

    <p>
        "MindWarrior" game takes privacy of the players very seriously.
        Your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i> is stored locally on your device and
        the game never copies or sends it to its servers.
        Therefore, it is physically impossible to see the <i>Formula</i> of a
        random player simply because the game itself doesn't have the access to it.
        (Please check our <a href="/privacy-policy.en.html" target="_blank">Privacy policy</a> for more details.)
    </p>
    <p>
        However, <strong>some players voluntarily shared their <i>Formulas</i> to the public
            on our website</strong>. These formulas could be found
        on "<a href="/public-formulas.en.html">Public Formulas</a>" page.
        Please feel free to check them out!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you'd like to help inspiring other players by sharing your own <i>Formula</i>, please follow
