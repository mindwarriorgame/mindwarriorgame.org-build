        Becoming better versions of ourselves leads us to better decisions, which result in better actions and
        outcomes for everyone to enjoy.

    <h3>Can I see Formulas of other players?</h3>

    <p>
        "MindWarrior" game takes privacy of the players very seriously.
        Your <i>Formula of firm resolution</i> is stored locally on your device and
        the game never copies or sends it to its servers.
        Therefore, it is physically impossible to see the <i>Formula</i> of a
        random player simply because the game doesn't have access to it.
        (Please check our <a href="/privacy-policy.en.html" target="_blank">Privacy policy</a> for more details.)
    </p>
    <p>
        However, <strong>some players voluntarily shared their <i>Formulas</i> in public
            on our website</strong>. These formulas could be found
        on "<a href="/public-formulas.en.html">Public Formulas</a>" page.
        Please feel free to check them out!

    <p>
        If you'd like to help inspiring other players by sharing your own <i>Formula</i>, please follow
