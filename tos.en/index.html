    <P style="padding-top: 0"><sub>Effevtive date: 2025-12-17</sub></p>

<p>MindWarrior is operated by an individual based in Australia (<i>we</i>, <i>us</i>).</p>

<p>By using MindWarrior (the <i>Service</i>), you agree to these Terms.</p>

<p>MindWarrior is a self-reflection / personal growth game that may include reminders, prompts, and a <i>Public Formulas</i> page containing selected examples submitted by players.</p>

<h3>2) Not professional advice</h3>
<p>The Service and any Public Formulas are provided for general information and inspiration only. They are <strong>not</strong> medical, mental-health/psychological, legal, or financial advice, and are not a substitute for professional care.</p>
<p>If you are in immediate danger or need urgent help, contact local emergency services. In Australia, you can contact <strong>Lifeline 13 11 14</strong>.</p>

<h3>3) Eligibility</h3>
<p>You must be at least <strong>16 years old</strong>, or have permission from a parent/guardian, to use the Service.</p>

<h3>4) Acceptable use</h3>
<p>You agree not to use the Service to break the law or violate anyone’s rights, harass/threaten/defame/impersonate anyone, submit or publish personal data about other people (including names or contact details), submit copyrighted text you don’t own, promote hate or self-harm or violence or illegal activity, or interfere with the Service (including spam, scraping, hacking, or abuse).</p>

<h3>5) Player submissions and Public Formulas</h3>
<p>Submissions are <strong>not published automatically</strong>. We may review, edit, reject, or remove submissions at any time.</p>
<p>If you submit a Formula for possible publication, you confirm it’s your original work (or you have rights to submit it), and that it does not include personal data about others, defamatory content, or harmful/illegal instructions.</p>

<h3>6) CC0 (public domain) for published Formulas</h3>
<p>If we publish your submission as a Public Formula, you agree it is released under <strong>CC0 (public domain)</strong>. This means anyone may use it without asking you. You consent to us formatting or editing it for clarity and safety.</p>

<h3>7) Reporting and removal requests</h3>
<p>We may remove any Public Formula at any time. To report a Public Formula or request removal, contact us (see below) with a link (or enough detail to find it). If you’re the submitter, you can also reach us using the same method you used to submit it.</p>

<h3>8) Third-party services</h3>
<p>The Service may use third-party platforms and providers (for example, Telegram and hosting/infrastructure). Their terms and policies also apply to your use of those services.</p>

<h3>9) Privacy</h3>
<p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <strong><a href="/privacy-policy.en.html">Privacy Policy</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>10) Availability and changes</h3>
<p>We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time. We don’t guarantee the Service will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free.</p>

<h3>11) Disclaimers</h3>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, the Service is provided <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong> without warranties.</p>

<h3>12) Limitation of liability</h3>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential loss (including loss of data, profits, or reputation) arising from your use of the Service.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms excludes consumer guarantees that cannot be excluded under the <strong>Australian Consumer Law</strong>.</p>

<h3>13) Governing law</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Australia</strong>. Any disputes are subject to the courts of <strong>Queensland</strong> (unless mandatory law says otherwise).</p>

<h3>14) Changes to these Terms</h3>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes to the Service, legal requirements, or how we operate. If we make changes, we will update the “Effective date” at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after the updated Terms are posted means you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>
