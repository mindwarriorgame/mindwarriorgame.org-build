    <p>Is this the second arrow?</p>
    <p>Is this clinging to a past that doesn’t exist? A future?</p>
    <p>Is this intoxication with the illusion of being right/of “me”?</p>

    <h1>Life or death?</h1>

    <p>Not playing? Forgot the timer? Forgot the phone? You know what will follow…</p>
    <p>Not playing = you’re on the side of evil, and that’s not an allegory. That’s how serious it is! And it’s not an accusation: it’s simply how the mind works, in fact.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>nothing to chase</h2>

    <p>There is only this experience — here and now.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to run anywhere or catch up to anything.</p>
    <p><strong>Wherever you arrive — that situation will be the place of practice.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>one minute of freedom</h2>

    <p>Put the illusion on pause for one minute!</p>
    <p>Nothing will change for the illusion if it postpones its immediate reactions and judgments. If it’s “right,” in a minute it can calmly take control again — fine.</p>
    <p><strong>Don’t judge events and don’t follow the mind for one minute! This minute of silence, when you can think, is a trick for escaping into freedom!</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>drop the poison now</h2>

    <p>Illusion is poison.</p>
    <p>You’ve seen how ants eat poison — with such pleasure!</p>
    <p>How much suffering has been created under the influence of this poison!</p>
    <p>You are not an ant: recognize the illusion, drop the poison immediately! Don’t overthink the first step — <strong>just reject it — NOW, and deal with the situation that follows</strong>.</p>
    <p>There is an event, and there is an emotional trace that doesn’t exist.</p>
    <p>Poison doesn’t require analysis; it requires recognition.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>the key is within you, not outside</h2>

    <p>Illusion whispers: “The cause of your pain is outside. Fix the world — and it will pass.”</p>
    <p>But that’s deception. Imagine you’re dying. Would you want to go back to today? Would you be glad? So why aren’t you glad now, when you’re in this situation right now?</p>
    <p>Remember eras of war and poverty! Now you have water, food, medicine, shelter, the internet. Why aren’t you happy?</p>
    <p><strong>You need to realize: frustration is not because of external factors or people, but because of yourself.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>painkillers get in the way of practice</h2>

    <p>Enjoying illusory poison is very harmful. It’s like a drug: you want it again and again. And when it’s unavailable, we suffer because we’re used to it.</p>
    <p>When we feel bad, the craving for “pain relief” replaces practice.<br>
       When we feel good, we lose awareness and fall asleep again.</p>
    <p><strong>The key to freedom is to remain aware and nonjudgmental in discomfort and in satisfaction.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>there is no past or future — why worry?</h2>

    <p>Illusion says the past and future are solid realities.</p>
    <p>In reality, the past has passed; the future doesn’t exist — and when it arrives, it immediately becomes the past, meaning it disappears.</p>
    <p>When the past and future become more real to us than our breath, we shoot ourselves with the second arrow — suffering we add ourselves.</p>
    <p>Clinging to the past intensifies pain. Clinging to the future poisons the present.</p>
    <p><strong>Leaving past and future in brackets, dropping evaluative judgment — is it really so bad in this very second? What is missing right now — in real experience, not in the story?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The moment that gave you frustration has already passed. The moment that gave you pleasure has too.</strong></p>
    <p>Learn from the past and care for the future — but do it from clarity, not from panic.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Illusion is a false premise.</h2>

    <p>But if the premise is false, then the conclusions will be false.</p>
    <p>Even “smart” plans built on fear and greed become random: they may look correct, but they will produce suffering — for me and for others.</p>
    <p>From a clear premise come clear actions.<br>
       From a kind premise — kind consequences.</p>
    <p>Illusion will dissolve anyway, but the consequences of actions will remain.</p>
    <p><strong>You are a transformer-knot in a network of causes and conditions,<br>
       and in every moment you choose which karma to strengthen in the world.</strong></p>

    <h2>enough light on the wall for happiness</h2>

    <p><strong>When you were a child, the play of light on the wall was enough to make you happy.</strong></p>
    <p>The world didn’t get worse. Illusion covered the light.</p>
    <p>We arrive in a new place — the first days everything is fresh.<br>
       Then the mind gets used to it, labels it: “I already know this” — and stops seeing.</p>
    <p>Don’t believe every story the mind tells about “boring,” “not enough,” “uninteresting.”<br>
       Try to notice beauty without commentary.</p>
    <p><strong>Don’t cling to a sweet habit: replace it with sober, nonjudgmental joy grounded in reality — in presence, gratitude, kindness.</strong></p>

    <h2>statistics</h2>

    <p>Do you know that in the world, every few minutes a child dies?</p>
    <p>Do you know how much suffering falls on animals?</p>
    <p>The people who do this are no different from you. You have the same mind. The same feelings. Pride. Envy. Anger. Faith in illusion. This is the great tragedy of all humanity. What will you do about it?</p>
    <p><strong>To recognize the movements of another mind as your own is practice.</strong> After all, you have felt all these movements yourself, just as they have. You are no better than others, and you can understand and see these movements the same way you see your own.</p>
    <p>If we’re talking about reality, not your illusory narrow-minded view, then this is reality.</p>
    <p><strong>Your mind or someone else’s mind — is there much difference? You are more than what illusion paints for you.</strong></p>
