    <p>Now!</p>
    <p>There’s nowhere to run and nothing to chase…</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Put the illusion on pause for one minute!</p>
    <p>Nothing will change for the illusion if it waits a bit with its immediate reactions and judgments. If it is “right”, then OK — in a minute it can take control back.</p>
    <p><strong>This minute of silence is your chance.</strong> Read below to win this one-minute argument.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion is poison.</p>
    <p>You’ve seen how ants eat poison — with such delight!</p>
    <p>How much suffering you caused when you were under the influence of illusion! How much suffering people have caused under the influence of this poison.</p>
    <p><strong>You are not an ant. Recognize the illusion, drop the poison immediately! Don’t overthink the first step, just drop it!</strong> You’ll deal with the consequences later. (Otherwise you are no different from Hitler and other villains.)</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the irritants are outside, that they must be changed.</p>
    <p>But in reality they are inside. Imagine you are on your deathbed. Would you want to come back to “today”? Would you be glad? Then why aren’t you glad now, when you’re actually in this situation!</p>
    <p>The source of suffering is not external, it is illusion (which convinces you of the opposite)!</p>
    <p>Illusion does not remind you how lucky you are to be born in the 21st century, to have access to clean water, the internet, stores, medicine (painkillers when treating a tooth).</p>
    <p><strong>In reality the source of suffering is inside. It is illusion. Stop seeing it in your surroundings!</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the past and future exist.</p>
    <p>In reality the past has passed, the future does not exist, and when it comes it will immediately become the past — that is, it will disappear.</p>
    <p>The illusory past and future are the “second arrow”. Shift your attention to your sensations in the present moment. Is it really so painful and unbearable that it deserves such a level of suffering?</p>
    <p>The roots of your suffering are in the past, which is not there, and in the future, which is not there.</p>
    <p><strong>In reality there is only “now”. Drop the past and the future, even the very next moment! If you are not “here and now”, you are a prisoner of illusion. Reset the past. Is it really that bad for you right now? Do you really lack anything in your current moment?</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>There is reality, and there is illusion.</p>
    <p>Actions taken from illusion are random and lead to suffering. (False premise.)</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at improving illusion are meaningless, because illusion does not exist in reality. It will dissolve together with your personality.</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at reducing the suffering of all living beings are your imprint in eternity. Karma does not disappear. This is the creation of conditions for a better world.</p>
    <p>You can suffer, or you can not suffer. Illusion will disappear, and reality will not care. Only actions and consequences matter. Illusion will dissolve, but the consequences will remain. It is foolish to use illusion as the basis for your thoughts and actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Reality will win anyway — drop illusion! Don’t think of it as something valuable, don’t regret it. The intoxicating, sweet poison does not leave emptiness when it goes; it is replaced by a healthier joy based on reality, not on phantoms.</strong></p>
    <p>Illusion can be useful, but there is a big difference between treating it as a parable (like an Aesop fable) and treating it as objective reality.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion does not let you enjoy reality.</p>
    <p>When you were little, you could rejoice at a shadow on the wall. Now your gaze has grown dull. The same thing happens when you arrive in a new place: at first it’s great, then you get bored.</p>
    <p>Why believe the nonsense stories invented by a mad mind? Why believe the illusion that devalues everything?</p>
    <p>Reality has not changed since then.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice the beauty around you! See reality as it is, without illusion or judgment.</strong> (Even the part that is inaccessible to direct contemplation because of your physical limitations.)</p>
    <p>It turns out that suffering is a personal choice: either you believe phantoms and illusion, or you believe reality. <strong>Choose!</strong></p>
