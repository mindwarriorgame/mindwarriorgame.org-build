    <p>Right now!</p>
    <p>There’s nowhere you need to rush and nothing you need to chase…</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Stop. Put the illusion on pause for at least one minute!</p>
    <p>Nothing will change for the illusion if it delays its instant reactions and judgments. If it’s “right”, in a minute it can take control again.</p>
    <p><strong>This minute of silence is your chance.</strong> Keep reading to win this one-minute argument with the illusion.</p>
    <p><strong>In reality, one minute of reflection before you start to SUFFER can spare you that suffering.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion is poison.</p>
    <p>You’ve seen how ants eat poison — with such delight!</p>
    <p>How much suffering you’ve caused while under the influence of illusion! How much suffering has been caused by people under the influence of this poison.</p>
    <p><strong>You are not an ant; recognize the illusion — drop the poison immediately! Don’t overthink the first step, just drop it!</strong> You can deal with the consequences later. (Otherwise you are no different from Hitler and other villains.)</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the irritants are outside and must be changed.</p>
    <p>But in fact they are inside. Imagine you are on your deathbed. Would you want to come back to today? Would you be happy? Then why aren’t you happy now, when you are already in this situation!</p>
    <p>The source of suffering is not external; it is illusion (which convinces you of the opposite)!</p>
    <p>Illusion doesn’t remind you how lucky you are to be born in the 21st century, to have access to clean water, the internet, shops, medicine (like painkillers at the dentist).</p>
    <p><strong>In reality, the source of suffering is inside. It is illusion. Let it go; stop seeing the source outside!</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the past and future exist.</p>
    <p>In reality, the past is gone, the future does not exist, and when it comes it immediately becomes the past — that is, it disappears.</p>
    <p>The illusory past and future are the “second arrow”. Shift your attention to your sensations in the present moment. Is it really so painful and unbearable that it deserves this level of suffering?</p>
    <p>The roots of your suffering are in a past that does not exist and a future that does not exist.</p>
    <p><strong>In reality there is only “now”; throw away past and future, even the very next moment! If you are not “here and now”, you are imprisoned by illusion. Reset the past. Are you really so bad off right now? Are you really missing something in your present moment?</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>There is reality, and there is illusion.</p>
    <p>Actions taken from illusion are random and lead to suffering. (The premise is false.)</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at improving illusion are meaningless, because illusion does not exist in reality. It will dissolve together with your personality.</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at reducing the suffering of all living beings are your imprint in eternity. Karma does not disappear. This is creating the conditions for a better world.</p>
    <p>You can suffer, or you can not suffer. Illusion will disappear, and reality doesn’t care. Only actions and consequences matter. Illusion will dissolve, but the consequences will remain. It is foolish to use illusion as the basis for your thoughts and actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Reality will win anyway; drop the illusion! Don’t think of it as something valuable.</strong></p>
    <p>Illusion can be useful, but there is a big difference between treating it as a parable (like one of Aesop’s fables) and treating it as objective reality.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion doesn’t let you enjoy reality.</p>
    <p>When you were little, you could delight in a shadow on the wall. Now your gaze has grown dull. The same thing happens when you arrive in a new place: at first it’s amazing, then you get bored.</p>
    <p>Why believe the rambling stories invented by a schizophrenic? Why believe the illusion that devalues everything?</p>
    <p>Reality has not changed since then.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice the beauty around you! See reality as it is, without illusions and judgments.</strong> (Even the parts that are not directly visible because of physical limits, like a wall.)</p>
