    <p>Now!</p>
    <p>There is nowhere you need to rush to and nothing you need to chase...</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion is poison.</p>
    <p>You've seen how ants eat poison, with such delight!</p>
    <p>How much suffering you caused when you were under the influence of illusion! How much suffering has been caused by people under the effect of this poison.</p>
    <p><strong>You are not an ant, recognize the illusion, drop the poison immediately!</strong> You will deal with the consequences. (Otherwise you are no different from Hitler and other villains.)</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the irritants are outside, that they must be changed.</p>
    <p>But in reality they are inside. Imagine you were diagnosed with cancer. Would you want to come back to today?</p>
    <p>The source of suffering is not external, but illusion (which convinces you of the opposite)!</p>
    <p>Illusion doesn't remind you how lucky you are to have been born in the 21st century, to have access to clean water, the internet, shops, medicine (painkillers when treating a tooth).</p>
    <p><strong>In reality, the source of suffering is inside. It is illusion. Let it go, stop seeing it outside!</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion says that the past and the future exist.</p>
    <p>In reality, the past has passed, the future does not exist, and when it comes it immediately becomes the past, that is, it disappears.</p>
    <p>The illusory past and future are the “second arrow”. Shift your attention to your sensations in the present moment. Is it really so painful and unbearable that it deserves this level of suffering?</p>
    <p>The roots of your suffering are in a past that does not exist and a future that does not exist.</p>
    <p><strong>In reality there is only “now”; discard past and future, even the very next moment! If you are not “here and now”, you are in the captivity of illusion. Reset the past. Is it really so bad for you right now? Are you really lacking anything in your present moment?</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>There is reality and there is illusion.</p>
    <p>Actions taken from illusion are random and lead to suffering. (False premise.)</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at improving the illusion are meaningless, because illusion does not exist in reality. It will dissolve together with your personality.</p>
    <p>Actions aimed at reducing the suffering of all living beings are your imprint in eternity. Karma does not disappear. This is the creation of conditions for a better world.</p>
    <p>You can suffer, or you can choose not to suffer. Illusion will disappear, and reality does not care. Only actions and consequences matter. Illusion will dissolve, but the consequences will remain. It is foolish to use illusion as the basis for your thoughts and actions.</p>
    <p><strong>Reality will win anyway, drop the illusion! Do not think of it as something valuable.</strong></p>
    <p>Illusion can be useful, but there is a big difference between relating to it as a parable (like an Aesop fable) and taking it as objective reality.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion does not let you stop and reflect.</p>
    <p>It drives you forward. Reply to the message, check the news, eat a candy…</p>
    <p><strong>In reality, your battle is here and now. This moment will not return. Stop and think! Let go!</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <p>Illusion does not let you enjoy reality.</p>
    <p>When you were little, you could rejoice at a shadow on the wall. Now your gaze has become dulled. The same thing happens when you arrive in a new place.</p>
    <p>Why believe the nonsense stories invented by a schizophrenic person? Why believe the illusion?</p>
    <p>Reality has not changed since then.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice the beauty around you! See reality as it is, without illusion or judgment.</strong> (Even that which is not accessible because of physical limitations, like a wall.)</p>
